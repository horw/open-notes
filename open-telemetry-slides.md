# The Three Pillars of Observability

<div>

Metrics - Logs - Tracing

# Metrics
Metrics are a numerical representation of data.

<div v-click.hide>


- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization metrics
- Error rates metrics
- Availability metrics
</div>

# Logs
Log files are the historical records of your systems. 


````md magic-move {lines: true}
```json
{"level":"info","msg":"Something noteworthy happened!","time":"2019-12-09T16:18:21+01:00"}
{"level":"warning","msg":"You should probably take a look at this.","time":"2019-12-09T16:18:21+01:00"}
{"level":"error","msg":"Something failed but I'm not quitting.","time":"2019-12-09T16:18:21+01:00"}
```

```md
A simple print statement such as `Hello, I reached here` can help in debugging a lot at times...
```

# Traces
Records the paths taken by requests.

Without tracing, finding the root cause of performance problems in a distributed system can be challenging.

# OpenTelemery
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/

OpenTelemetry is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to <span v-mark.circle.green="1">create</span> and <span v-mark.circle.green="1">manage</span> telemetry data such as <span v-mark.circle.green="1"> traces, metrics, and logs</span>. Crucially, OpenTelemetry is vendor- and tool-agnostic, meaning that it can be used with a broad variety of Observability backends, including open source tools like Jaeger and Prometheus, as well as commercial offerings.

OpenTelemetry<span v-mark.circle.red="2"> is not an observability backend</span> like Jaeger, Prometheus, or other commercial vendors. OpenTelemetry is focused on the generation, collection, management, and export of telemetry. A major goal of OpenTelemetry is that you can easily instrument your applications or systems, no matter their language, infrastructure, or runtime environment. Crucially, the<span v-mark.circle.red="2"> storage and visualization </span>of telemetry is intentionally left to other tools.

# OpenTelemetry Protocol
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/<br/>

The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) specification describes the encoding, transport, and delivery mechanism of telemetry data between telemetry sources, intermediate nodes such as collectors and telemetry backends.
